This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

**PREREQUISITE: Edit "homepage" in `package.json` file and replace "username" with your username.**

**PREREQUISITE: Change the "source branch" in the Github Pages setting on your Github repo to `gh-pages`**

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

Your app will then be deployed to the `gh-pages` branch of your github repository.
